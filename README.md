#                         Simple-interest
# The calculator accepts Principal(p), Rate(r) and Time(t) 
# To use the simple interest calculator, firstly import the module named "si_calc".
# Secondly, type the module name, followed by a full stop then the function (example: si_calc.i).
# Thirdly, input the three values; Principal(amount of money), Rate(in percentage %) and Time(duration) respectively in a bracket after the function.(example:250, 6, 0.25)
# For Time in month, divide by 12.(example: 3 months = 3/12 = 0.025)
# Run the code to calculate Simple interest.


#                        Principal
# The calculator accepts Simple interest(i), Rate(r) and Time(t) 
# To use Principal calculator, firstly import the module named "si_calc".
# Secondly, type the module name, followed by a full stop then the function (example: si_calc.p).
# Thirdly, input the three values; Simple interest(interest on loan), Rate(in percentage %) and Time(duration).(example:3.75, 6, 0.25)
# For Time in month, divide by 12.(example: 3 months = 3/12 = 0.025)
# Run the code to calculate Principal.


#                        Rate
# The calculator accepts Simple interest(i), Principal(p) and Time(t) 
# To use Rate calculator, firstly import the module named "si_calc".
# Secondly, type the module name, followed by a full stop then the function (example: si_calc.r).
# Thirdly, input the three values; Simple interest(interest on loan),Principal(amount of money) and Time(duration) .(example:3.75, 250, 0.25)
# For Time in month, divide by 12.(example: 3 months = 3/12 = 0.025)
# Run the code to calculate Rate.


#                        Time
# The calculator accepts Rate(r), Simple interest(i) and Principal(p) 
# To use Time calculator, firstly import the module named "si_calc".
# Secondly, type the module name, followed by a full stop then the function (example: si_calc.t).
# Thirdly, input the three values; Rate(in percentage %), Simple interest(interest on loan) and Principal(amount of money).(example:6, 3.75, 250)
# Run the code to calculate Time.
